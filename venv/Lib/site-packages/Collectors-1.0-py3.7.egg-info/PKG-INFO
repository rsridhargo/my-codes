Description: 
        Collectors
        ==========
        
        *Collectors* was initially developed to monitor 
        `SimPy <http://simpy.sourceforge.net/>`_ simulation models but it can also be used to monitor any Python objects and collect data from them.
        
        Our main development goals were:
        
        * Ease of use (simple API, little typing)
        * Efficiency:
        
          * No impact on simulation speed if you donâ€™t use it.
          * As little impact as possible if you use it.
        
        * Flexibility and easy extensibility
        * Separation of data collection and data analysis
        
        Simple usage example
        --------------------
        
            >>> class Spam(object):
            ...     a = 1
            ...     b = 2
            ...
            >>> spam = Spam()
            >>>
            >>> # Create and configure the collector
            >>> col = Collector(
            ...     ('a', lambda: spam.a),
            ...     ('b', lambda: self.b)
            ... )
            >>>
            >>> # Collect all monitored variables (spam.a and spam.b)
            >>> col()
            >>> spam.a, spam.b = 3, 4
            >>> col()
            >>>
            >>> # Get the collectorâ€™s data
            >>> col
            ([1, 3], [2, 4])
            >>> # You can also access it's elements by their name ...
            >>> col.a
            [1, 3]
            >>> # ... or by their index
            >>> col[1]
            [2, 4]
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        *Collectors* has only been tested with *Python 2.6* but older versions should
        also work. *Python 3.0* might also work; if not, weâ€™ll put it on our schedule.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install *Collectors* is via 
        `PIP <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_ or 
        `distribute <http://packages.python.org/distribute/>`_::
        
            pip install Collectors
            
        or ::
        
            easy_install Collectors
        
        If you downloaded the archive, execute::
        
            python setup.py install
            
        And finally, if you checked out the repository and always want to use the newest 
        version, type::
        
            pip install -e path/to/Collectors
            
        or ::
        
            pip install -e https+hg://bitbucket.org/scherfke/collectors/
